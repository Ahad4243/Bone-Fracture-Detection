# Bone-Fracture-Detection
This project employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify fractures in the elbow, hand, and shoulder using the MURA dataset. By automating fracture detection with high accuracy, it streamlines musculoskeletal radiograph analysis, supporting efficient and reliable medical diagnosis.
